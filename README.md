# Intelligent Placement Management System — Project Proposal

## 1. Introduction

**Intelligent Placement Management System** is a comprehensive, full-stack campus placement management platform engineered for educational institutions. It digitises and streamlines the end-to-end placement lifecycle — from company onboarding and eligibility verification to assessment administration, result analysis, and offer tracking — through a single unified portal accessible to administrators and students alike.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Campus placement processes in most institutions are managed through spreadsheets, emails, and manual coordination. This leads to:

- **Inefficient eligibility screening** — manual cross-referencing of student profiles against company criteria.
- **Lack of transparency** — students remain uninformed about upcoming drives, eligibility status, and results.
- **Assessment integrity risks** — paper-based or loosely proctored online tests are vulnerable to malpractice.
- **Administrative overhead** — repetitive tasks such as notifications, report generation, and data collation consume significant faculty time.
- **No centralised data** — placement records are scattered, making analytics and auditing difficult.

---

## 3. Proposed Solution

Intelligent Placement Management System addresses these challenges through a role-based web application with the following pillars:

| Pillar | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Centralised Management** | Single platform for companies, tests, students, and results |
| **Automated Eligibility** | Real-time matching of student profiles against company criteria |
| **Secure Assessments** | Fullscreen-locked, proctored online tests with anti-cheat mechanisms |
| **AI-Powered Insights** | Automated question generation, feedback, and marks card verification |
| **Real-Time Communication** | In-app and email notifications for every placement event |
